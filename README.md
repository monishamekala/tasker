# 📱 Team Workflow System

A distributed, Slack-like task management platform enabling real-time task collaboration, offline edits, and resilient event syncing across global teams.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Real-Time Sync:** Sub-100ms updates across all users via RocketMQ.
- 📴 **Offline Editing:** CRDTs enable seamless merging after reconnection.
- 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control:** Define permissions by user roles.
- 🕓 **Event Timeline:** Full task history stored in Cassandra.
- 🧠 **Smart Workers:** Distributed C++ processors for SLA checks, reminders.

| Layer                | Technology                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend (optional) | React.js or Electron                |
| Backend             | C++                                 |
| Messaging Queue     | RocketMQ                            |
| Storage             | MongoDB (tasks, users) + Cassandra (events) |
| Conflict Resolution | CRDTs (LWW registers, OR-Sets)      |
| Orchestration       | Docker, Kubernetes, Helm            |
| Observability       | Prometheus, Grafana                 |
| CI/CD               | GitHub Actions + Helm               |

## 📦 Architecture

- Distributed backend written in **C++**
- Messaging and coordination via **RocketMQ**
- Event storage in **Cassandra**, document storage in **MongoDB**
- **CRDT-based conflict resolution** for offline syncing
- Kubernetes-managed microservices and worker nodes

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

- 🧪 Simulated 10K+ concurrent users
- ⚙️ 5M+ events/day with sustained <150ms sync latency
- 🛡️ 99.9% availability under K8s disruption simulations

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters (for Apple)

- Mastery of **application-layer C++** for distributed systems
- Hands-on **event-driven architecture** using RocketMQ
- Real-world use of **MongoDB + Cassandra**
- Deep understanding of **replication, CRDTs, HA**
- Production-grade **Kubernetes deployment & observability**

## 📂 Setup Instructions

> Minimum Requirements: C++20, MongoDB, Cassandra, RocketMQ, Docker, Kubernetes

```bash
# Build backend core
cd backend
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Setup RocketMQ and MongoDB (example using docker-compose)
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy with Helm (after configuring values)
helm install task-manager ./helm/charts
